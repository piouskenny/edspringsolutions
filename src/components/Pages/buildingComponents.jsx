                Professional Learning Opportunities for Instructional Staff:
              </span>
              For instructional staff to create nurturing learning experiences
              for students, they require continuous professional learning
              opportunities tailored to their specific needs and roles. Research
              has established that effective professional development for
              educators can improve student learning outcomes, with some studies
              showing gains of up to 21 percentile points. Teachers in the
              United States spend an average of 89 hours per year on
              professional development. However, many teachers reported feeling
              unsatisfied with the quality and relevance of the training they
              received.{" "}
              <a

                className="text-blue-600"
              >
                According to a survey conducted by the Bill and Melinda Gates
                Foundation, only 29% of teachers were very satisfied with the
                professional development they received.{" "}
              </a>
              This suggests a gap between the types of professional development
              opportunities offered and what teachers need to improve their
              effectiveness in the classroom. To address this issue, we ensure
              that our professional development offerings are grounded in
              research and are designed to be relevant, differentiated,
              engaging, and effective.

                Leadership Support and Coaching:
              </span>
              Leadership coaching for school administration is becoming
              increasingly important as schools face a range of complex
              challenges and shifting educational landscapes. To this end,
              school administrators require professional learning opportunities
              in leading equitable schools that ensure all students have access
              to high-quality education. This included meeting the needs of
              students with disabilities, leading schools to support diverse
              learners, equitably serving all students, and meeting the needs of
              English learners. Unfortunately, while the evidence points to the
              efficacy of coaching support for school administration, fewer than
              one quarter (23%) of principals reported having a mentor or coach
              in the past 2 yearsâ€”and this percentage was lower for principals
              in high-poverty schools (10%),{" "}
